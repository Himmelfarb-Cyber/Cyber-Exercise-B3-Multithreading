Exercise 6 - Programming in Python 

Use data structures, functions, exceptions and I/O as we learned in the class.

1.	
There is an input text file in which contains a stream of words in the following format:
Each word is described by 3 values: 
-	Length of Length represents the number of characters representing the length
-	Length is the length of the text
-	Text is the text itself (including trailing spaces)
For example: the text “Programming in Python” will be represented as following:
212Programming 13in 16Python 

Implement a function that gets the file name as a parameter and prints only the words with even length (אורך זוגי). If there is a problem with the data write “Error”.



2.	
There are 3 input files. Each one contains a stream of text characters. Some of these characters are valid hex numbers. 
Write a function that gets 3 file names and returns a summary of all the hexa values that are written in them. So the following line will print the summary:
print(summary_files(“file1.txt”, “file2.txt”, “file3.txt”))


3.	
Write a function that reads a number from a file.
If the number is 2 print “Up”, if number is 4 print “Left”, if number is 6 print “Right”, if number is 8 print “Down”. In all other cases print “Invalid Move”
You are not allowed to use an if command.
